### Hi there, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I have always been fascinated by the world of technology and computing!

For this reason, I decided to turn my professional life around by approaching the world that I have always been passionate about, programming in particular. This passion has led me to train as a Full-Stack developer, discovering a world of new challenges and projects.

Always eager to offer my experience and knowledge in various technologies and different workflows, with a work and personal responsibility based on discipline, a vocation for the new and a predisposition to continuous learning, all in a good environment. of work and team unity!
